# Face-recognition-using--image-processing

The uniqueness or individuality of an individual is his face. In this project
face of an individual is used for the purpose of attendance making automatically.
Attendance of the student is very important for every college, universities, and
school. Conventional methodology for taking attendance is by calling the name or
roll number of the student and the attendance is recorded. Time consumption for this
purpose is an important point of concern. Assume that the duration for one subject is
around 60 minutes or 1 hour & to record attendance takes 5 to 10 minutes. For every
tutor, this is a consumption of time. To stay away from these losses, an automatic
process is used in this project which is based on image processing. In this project
face detection and face recognition are used. Face detection is used to locate the
position of the face region and face recognition is used for marking the understudyâ€™s
attendance.
The database of all the students in the class is stored and when the face of the
individual student matches with one of the faces stored in the database then the
attendance is recorded. Face detection and recognition is performed using
Haar-Cascade classifier and Local Binary Pattern Histogram algorithm
respectively. Faces are detected and recognized from live image of the
classroom. This proposed system will be implemented with 4 phases such as Image
Capturing, Segmentation of group image and Face Detection, Face comparison and
Recognition, Updating of Attendance in database.
